## The Empirical Evaluation of Management Practices

### University of Cologne

#### Winter 2024/25

_Prof. Dr. Dirk Sliwka and Sander Kraaij_

### Organizational Issues

- The sessions take place on _Mondays (14:00-17:45)_ and _Tuesdays (09:00-11:45)_ during the first term of the semester.
   	- Lecture room: 101 Seminarraum 0.224 (WiSo building)
	- Note that we start an hour later on Tuesday than announced on KLIPS.
- We will be using Google Colab throughout the course.
	- You can find information about this service [here](https://colab.research.google.com/).
	- Please bring a laptop (or tablet with a keyboard) to all sessions because we will interactively work with Python in Google Colab.
	- Since Google Colab requires an internet connection, please make sure you have a working connection at the university.
	- Google Colab also requires a Google account. If you do not have an account, you can create one for free. You do not need to add any personal information to your account to use Colab.

### Examination format
- The exam consists of group work and a multiple-choice exam. **Please register until October 15!**
- **Group work:**
  - At the end of the second week of the semester, you will be assigned to a group. We will randomly allocate students to groups during the course. 
  - In the group, you will analyze a data set of your own choice and apply the methods learned in class. This assignment is designed to help students apply the skills learned in the course to a practical application of their choice.
  - Some [hints](./Exam/TaskHints.pdf) on how to proceed in your group work

	- Some [Football Data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/codytipton/player-stats-per-game-understat) - See also [Notebook](./Notebooks/LoadSoccerData.ipynb)

  - The groups will give short presentations of their work (15 minutes per group + 10 minutes of discussion) on **November 18-19** during the scheduled lecture slots. Groups must hand in their slides and a Juypter Notebook with their analysis code, explanation, and interpretation by **November 18** at noon. Each group will be assigned to a time slot to present without the presence of the other groups.
- **Multiple-choice exam:** There will be two exam dates, but we encourage you to take the first one (registration until October 15)
	- The 60-minute exam will consist of 15 multiple-choice questions
 	- [Example exam questions](./Exam/example_exam_questions.pdf)
  	- First Exam: November 30, 2024, 13:00-14:00 at 100 Hörsaal II (main building)
  	- Second exam: March 12, 2025, 14:00-15:00 at 100 Hörsaal XVIIa (main building)
  	- Registration for the exam takes place as usual on KLIPS. If you are a doctoral student and do not have access to the course on KLIPS, please write to kraaij[at]wiso.uni-koeln.de that you want to take the exam.
